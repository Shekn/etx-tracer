# Building etx-tracer

This description will be updated during the development process.

At the moment there is nothing to build.

## Requirements
Most of external libraries will be located directly in the source code, to reduce a number of dependencies and make building faster.
But this libraries and tools you have to install by yourself:
- CMake
- CUDA
- OptiX
- optionally OpenVDB if you want to load .vdb files with volumetric data.
